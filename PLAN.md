## Gates (Jacob's calls — do not relitigate)

- **Gate 1**: no real money until demonstrably profitable in demo, judged by
  the pre-declared thresholds in
  [docs/PRE_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md](docs/PRE_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md) (**still DRAFT —
  Jacob must ratify §2**).
- **Gate 2**: no scaling / multi-exchange until profitable on Kalshi. One
  market at a time until the edge is proven.
- **North-star**: FIX access — requires ≥5% of exchange-wide monthly volume
  (Kalshi Institutional, 2026-07-04). A scale gate, not a tech unlock; the
  road is Gate 1 → Gate 2 → volume. REST+WS is our platform for the
  foreseeable future.
- **Boundary**: host health (clock sync, disk, OS) is ops' job, not bot code
  (item 46 closed unmerged on this principle).

## Now (ordered)

1. [x] **Validate the D13/D14 fixes live.** *PASSED — run 12 (2026-07-04
   21:15, 5 min, self-selected in-play MLB PHI@KC): **0 fades, 0 fade-pends,
   ~1.3 order-moves/min** (vs 133 fades / 42 moves/min in run 7 pre-fix) on a
   live in-play book; 3 maker fills, markout@30s 0.00c (n=3, within the
   ≥−0.5c bound); repricing tracked the game via 4 atomic amends (L2 live);
   clean flatten −$0.03. The startup market self-selection picked the live
   game unaided.*
2. [x] **L0 — latency baseline.** *Done — per-request RTT flows into the
   analytics JSONL (`type:"http"`); `scripts/latency_report.py` prints
   p50/p95/max per endpoint. Mac baseline (2026-07-04): order-path ~294ms,
   orderbook ~76ms, general GETs p50 184ms — the numbers L1 must beat.*
3. [ ] **L1 — EC2 in Kalshi's region** (t4g.small ~$12/mo; NOT a trading-VPS
   product). **Region answered by Kalshi Institutional (Brad, 2026-07-11):
   us-east-2 (Ohio) is the recommended lowest-latency region** — no probe
   needed. Rerun the L0 session from Ohio; fold host into Phase 32
   supervision. Same email: rate-limit tiers above Advanced are Premier
   (1k/1k per sec), Paragon (2k/2k), Prime (4k/4k), unlocked by volume
   share and reviewed daily — the write-budget ladder for items 54/L3.
4. [x] **L2 = item 44 — Amend + Decrease Order V2.** *Done — semantics
   pinned live (amend = POST .../orders/{id}/amend with a full order body,
   response may carry a new order_id per official docs, demo returns the
   same; decrease = .../decrease keeps the id = keeps priority). The quoter
   reprice branch now issues ONE atomic amend instead of cancel+replace
   (fallback to cancel+replace on amend rejection; self-cross still cancels).
   Halves reprice round-trips and removes the quote-less window — the D9
   echo root. `decrease_order` is available for the flow guard's future
   size response (item 32/24).* Original scope: One atomic call replaces
   cancel+replace (no quote-less window, likely no book echo = the D9 root).
   Pin semantics first via demo-conformance tests: amend price → priority
   lost, no dead-level echo; decrease size → priority kept. Decrease gives
   queue-preserving inventory control.
5. [ ] **L3 — async order dispatch** (sanctioned Phase-21 pull-forward): order
   REST calls block the WS thread today; the bot is deaf while one is in
   flight.
6. [ ] **L4 — timer teardown.** After L2 proves echo-free AND item-1
   validation holds: shrink `min_rest_ms`/`fade_rest_ms` toward zero
   (config-only). Governors that remain: reprice threshold, write budget, RTT.
7. [ ] **19 — Jacob ratifies Gate-1 thresholds** (PRE_LIVE_CHECKLIST §2);
   the 14-session/30h measurement window can't start until frozen.
8. [ ] **Phase 32 minimum — unattended supervision** (launchd/systemd on the
   L1 host, logrotate, Telegram alert on halt/error) — required for the 30h
   soak.
9. [ ] **31a/31c — finish the measurement backbone**: settlement join + Brier
   scoring (quote stream already persisted); PnL attribution split (spread vs
   mark-to-market vs inventory vs fees).
10. [ ] **51 — panic pull tier (Jacob to confirm)**: on a catastrophic jump
    (≥ `panic_jump_cents`, e.g. 8), cancel the toxic side instantly — no
    confirmation, no rest floor, no re-quote until the book settles.
11. [x] **32 — directional flow lean + inventory brake.** *Done — while the
    flow guard is imbalanced, fair value leans `flow_lean_cents` (1c) toward
    the takers' side (believe persistent flow; decays with the guard's 5-min
    window); and at `inventory_cap_lots` × quote_size (2× = 20) the
    accumulating side stops quoting entirely — the run-13 pattern (30-lot
    pile-up into a trend, drift −$0.42 + exit −$1.05) is now capped at 20
    with the belief already leaning toward the move. Validated — run 14
    A/B on run 13's market: −$0.78 → −$0.20, peak inventory 30 → 10, drift
    −$0.42 → −$0.10, exit −$1.05 → −$0.35, entry edge stayed positive
    (+2.5c/lot).* Original scope: signed IR → bounded offset (Bawa p.8).
12. [ ] **24 — layered quoting (queue priming)**: 2–3 size layers 1–3c behind
    the inside; queue position is earned by resting before the move.
13. [ ] **42b — queue-value reprice rule**: only reprice when
    `|fv − quoted| · fill_prob` beats the queue value abandoned (needs 31
    fill-prob data).
14. [x] **53 — order janitorial.** *Done — startup cancels every resting
    order account-wide; shutdown sweeps `get_open_orders()` with retries
    until the exchange confirms clean. Validated live same day.*
15. [x] **49 — scanner liveness filter.** *Done — candidates whose last
    public trade is older than `max_stale_trade_minutes` (30) are dropped;
    validated live (picked the one genuinely trading market).*
16. [x] **52 — in-session market rotation.** *Done — every
    `rotation_minutes` (5) the session re-scans, drops dead+idle markets
    (never with a position or resting orders), adopts live picks.
    Follow-up 2026-07-04: **market selection moved into startup** — the
    session scans for its own tickers when `target_tickers` is empty (now
    the default); `--scan` is research-only; the generated
    `config-demo.trade.json` two-process workflow and `write_trade_config`
    were removed; `run_demo.sh` is single-process.*
17. [ ] **45 — decision-oriented quote logging** (the "why" per placement:
    spread components, reprice reason; latency counters fold into L0).
18. [ ] **23 — ceil-per-order maker-fee model** (mostly inert while demo maker
    fills are free); **3 — passive clamp vs fresher BBO** (D1 residual;
    largely solved by L1+L2).

19. [ ] **54 — batch CreateOrders (Jacob, 2026-07-04).** Kalshi V2 supports
    batch create/cancel (token cost per item, batch size scales with tier).
    Batch the session's order placements — seeds and layered quotes (item
    24) especially — into one request: fewer round trips, coherent quote
    placement. Sequence after L3 (async dispatch) so batching composes with
    the non-blocking order path.

20. [ ] **55 — demo conformance suite in CI (Jacob, 2026-07-04).** Run the
    live `demo_conformance_test` in CI (nightly schedule + manual dispatch,
    not per-PR): needs demo creds as GitHub Actions secrets (`KALSHI_DEMO_
    API_KEY` + PEM written to a runner temp file, `KALSHI_DEMO_CONFIG`
    generated in the job). Non-required job — it places real demo orders; a
    red nightly means schema drift or demo outage, both worth an alert.
    Skips are failures (Jacob): tests self-find a market (scanner pick →
    any open market → FAIL); only missing creds may skip. Local status
    2026-07-04: 12/12 pass live, ~5 min.

21. [x] **56 — passive wind-down before session end (found by run-12
    attribution).** *Done — on shutdown the quoter goes reduce-only (only the
    inventory-reducing side quotes; the accumulating side is cancelled; flat
    markets place nothing) and works the position out as a MAKER for up to
    `quoter.winddown_seconds` (45; 0 = old behavior) while the feed stays
    live; only the remainder is taker-flattened. Turns the exit from paying
    the spread into earning it.* Original finding: The session-end flatten is a TAKER order: it pays the
    spread plus any drift, and on short sessions it systematically gives
    back the maker edge (run 12: entries earned +$0.015, the flatten gave
    back ~−$0.045 → net −$0.03; zero pick-offs, zero holding drift — the
    exit was the entire loss). Fix: in the final N minutes, stop opening and
    quote-out inventory passively (one-sided maker quotes at/inside the
    reservation); flatten only what remains at the bell. Longer sessions
    dilute the same fixed cost.
22. [~] **31c — PnL attribution: shipped `scripts/pnl_attribution.py`**
    (entry_edge / drift / exit_cost split + per-fill quote-age and pre-fill
    belief drift = the picked-off / latency-loss detector). record_flatten
    now emits analytics fill events so exits are measurable. Remaining:
    fees term once maker-fee markets are traded; 31a Brier join unchanged.

23. [x] **57 — skew-per-fill cap (Jacob's catch, 2026-07-04).** *Done — with
    b anchored only to max_position (~45.5), ONE quote-sized fill shifted the
    reservation ~5.5c past the 2c half-spread: buy 50 → offer 49, a locked-in
    loss on every calm round trip. b is now floored at 25×quote_size (=250),
    holding a single-fill shift to ~1c at mid: buy 50 → offer 53, next bid 49
    (the gradual directional widening) — skew biases flow, never quotes a
    guaranteed loss. Trade-off: at max_position the reservation reaches
    ~±10c, not the band edge; the position cap remains the hard stop.
    Regression: SingleFillNeverQuotesAGuaranteedLossExit.*

24. [ ] **58 — scanner startup efficiency (external review, 2026-07-04).**
    Startup scans ~50k markets for ~28s before quoting. Query
    `status=open` server-side, cap pagination, and/or cache market metadata
    between runs with incremental refresh. Not latency-critical yet;
    becomes waste on the VM and on every rotation re-scan.
25. [~] **59 — short-horizon markout (external review).** *Script half done —
    `analyze_fills.py` reports markout@500ms/1s/5s alongside 30s/5min, a
    signed per-fill edge (mid-native − price), and aggregates edge + markout
    by pre-fill inventory bucket (0 / ≤10 / ≤20 / >20 contracts) — the
    run-13 "does fill quality rot as we accumulate" question, answerable per
    session. Remaining: avg-entry/mark/edge in the per-fill status log
    (folds into item 45).* Original scope: Add 500ms / 1s /
    5s horizons to `analyze_fills.py` alongside 30s/5min — the fast
    horizons separate "quoting too aggressive" (instant reversion) from
    genuine adverse selection (slow drift). Also aggregate edge by
    inventory level and add avg-entry/mark/edge to the per-fill status log
    (folds into item 45).

26. [ ] **60 — regression calibration (Jacob, 2026-07-04).** Two tiers:
    (a) **Drift estimator — build first, needs no fill history**:
    significance-gated rolling regression (slope + t-stat) of the smoothed
    mid over the last N minutes, fit on the quote-event stream we already
    log every tick. Fires on structural trends (mention-market staircase),
    silent on random-walk chop. Uses, both defensive: scale the flow lean
    (`lean = clamp(k·slope·horizon, ±max)`, replacing the fixed 1c —
    Avellaneda-Stoikov with a drift term) and **penalize |slope| in the
    scanner** — a significantly trending book is where makers bleed
    (run 14's residual −$0.20); prefer two-sided chop, where spread pays.
    (b) **Fill-history models — gated on ~500 accumulated fills**: toxicity
    regression (post-fill markout on flow ratio, book imbalance, inventory,
    spread → per-fill required-edge floor, replacing literature constants);
    learned micro-price (future mid on mid/micro/imbalance blend); logistic
    fill-probability (unblocks 42b queue-value and 28 Kelly sizing). Every
    soak session's analytics JSONL is the training set.

27. [x] **61 — sparse/tight-book admission (run 15, 2026-07-05).** Run 15
    made $0: the scanner picked a market with zero trades during the window
    (nearest public trade ~70 min after shutdown) and a penny-wide inside
    (our 4c-edge ask rested 5c behind; a 24c competitor print would take any
    flow first). volume_24h credited yesterday's event burst. *Done — the
    scanner's finalist probe now (a) requires ≥ `min_trades_per_hour`
    (default 6) public trades within the past hour — and a parsed-but-empty
    trade tape is a definitive drop, no longer fail-open — and (b) fetches
    the LIVE orderbook and drops candidates whose visible spread is tighter
    than `min_spread_cents` (scan-time market data can lie). Probe errors
    still fail open. Covers startup selection and rotation (both call
    `scan()`).* Ops half, not code: sessions must overlap live slates —
    quiet-morning runs produce $0 by construction.

28. [x] **62 — expired-event / pinned-tape gate (Jacob's catch, 2026-07-05).**
    Run 16 re-picked the July-4 rally mention market ON JULY 5 — the event
    already happened, every outcome real-world determined (Kalshi chart: all
    pinned ≤1%), yet it passed item 61: demo bots printed 10 trades/hour and
    the book was 3c+ wide. **No metadata exposes this** — verified live:
    `expected_expiration_time` = `close_time` = Jul 19 (settlement window),
    `result` empty, status active, `liquidity_dollars` = \$0 on every demo
    market, event object has no strike date. The tape is the tell: *every
    print at exactly 24c for an hour* — trades without price discovery = a
    determined market where only informed takers remain. *Done — finalists'
    last-hour prints must span ≥ `min_trade_price_range_cents` (2) and
    include ≥2 recent prints; reuses the item-61 trades probe (prices now
    parsed alongside times), zero extra REST calls.* Jacob's rule, adopted:
    **liquidity is a GATE, not a score input** — flow, spread, and tape
    gates all must pass before score matters at all; a 0.957 volume score
    cannot buy admission.

29. [x] **63 — pre-game markets are makeable (Jacob's catch, 2026-07-05).**
    The tape gate's 1-hour window false-positived the Brazil–Norway
    pre-game mention markets ("this isn't a live event BUT I can currently
    market make on it"): real price discovery in steps all morning, quiet
    last hour → wrongly "pinned". *Done — tape range now looks back
    `tape_range_lookback_minutes` (default 180): pre-game steps count,
    determined markets stay pinned across any window.* Second finding, a
    config stance not code: the 2c-wide headliners (Penalty Kick 58/44 etc.)
    never reached finalists because the scan spread floor was 3c —
    config-demo now runs `scanner.min_spread_cents=2` and quoter
    `target=3/min=2` so demo sessions can quote competitively on 2c books
    (demo maker fees are 0; revisit both floors for production fees).
    Principle refined: **"live event" is not the criterion — current
    two-sided flow is.**

30. [x] **64 — asymmetric unwind pricing (Jacob, 2026-07-05: "collect true
    spread, stay balanced, no inventory").** Run 18 exposed it: after 10
    one-sided fills our belief rose to ~81.5, yet the buy-back bid rested at
    78–79 — the quoter charged a full half-spread to CLOSE a position, so
    inventory sat until the taker flatten paid 83 (the whole −$0.10). *Done —
    with inventory on, the reducing side quotes at the reservation price plus
    only `unwind_edge_cents` (default 0), passive-clamped to 1c inside the
    market; the increasing side keeps full spread + skew + lean. Opening
    risk charges premium; closing risk pays up to fair value. Round trips
    complete at the first counter-flow; spread capture = the opening side's
    edge, banked per loop instead of hoped for. Wind-down inherits this
    automatically (reduce side now rests at reservation, not res−half).*

31. [ ] **66 — clearing-price fair value (Jacob, 2026-07-05).** "The best
    price is the one that would allow for the most trades on the orderbook"
    — the top-of-book micro-price is measuring the wrong thing in these
    books: it sees only L1 (bot walls dominate) and ignores the tape
    entirely (run 18: fv said 80 while 100% of volume printed at 82; the
    recurring drift line — −$0.59 in run 19, −$0.42 in run 13, always
    against held inventory — is the same bias in dollars). Build
    `ClearingPriceModel` as a third `IPricingModel`: fv = blend of (a) the
    **full-depth uncrossing price** (walk the ladder; the price maximizing
    executable volume where cumulative demand meets supply) and (b) the
    **recent-print VWAP** (where trades actually clear), EMA-smoothed as
    today, config-selected. **Validate offline first**: backtest micro vs
    uncrossing vs tape-blend on the recorded analytics/capture sessions,
    scored on next-print prediction error and simulated drift — the winner
    on recordings gets the live switch (60b's learned micro-price with a
    structural prior). Caveat noted: our own fills print at our ask by
    construction; the unbiased evidence is drift + the run-18 tape.
    **Full plan: [BETTER_PRICING.md](BETTER_PRICING.md).** Progress: Phases
    0+1 shipped 2026-07-09 — WS `trade` channel subscribed (parsed via
    `taker_outcome_side`; captures now record the tape) and `TradeTape`
    (per-market rolling prints, own fills excluded by trade_id, time-decayed
    VWAP + print count + minority-side ratio), fed by the session. Phase 2
    shipped 2026-07-09: `LocalOrderbook::clearing_price_cents(DepthWeighting)`
    — the micro-price generalized to the full ladder (flat / distance-decay /
    top-K weightings for the backtest grid; reduces exactly to micro at one
    level per side). Phase 3a (candle tier) ran 2026-07-09 on 30 production
    markets / 4,014 events (`scripts/backtest_fv_candles.py`; table +
    interpretation in BETTER_PRICING.md): **the book stays the anchor**
    (mid beats every tape variant on MAE in every spread bucket — tape
    lags), but the mid carries run-18's bias in production (−0.2/−0.4c,
    prints land above it) and a low tape blend (w≈0.1–0.25) zeroes it.
    Phase 4 is therefore NOT tape-heavy: clearing-price anchor + small tape
    correction. **Phase 4 shipped 2026-07-10**: `ClearingPriceModel`
    (fv = (1−w)·EMA-micro + w·tape-VWAP, sparse-tape fallback to anchor)
    selected by `quoter.use_clearing_pricing` with `clearing_tape_weight`
    (0.5) and `tape_half_life_seconds` (30) — defaults are the midpoint of
    the offline bracket (liquid books said ~0.25, thin demo books rewarded
    up to 1.0); the quoter feeds the model the live TradeTape VWAP. OFF by
    default: run 20 (matched-market A/B vs HeuristicModel, scored on round
    trips + drift dollars) decides the flip. Phase 3b harness shipped
    2026-07-10: `kalshi_mm --fv-replay
    <capture/session.jsonl>` replays a recorded session through the
    PRODUCTION parse path (`WebSocketClient::inject_frame`), LocalOrderbook,
    and TradeTape, grading a 39-candidate grid (micro/clearing anchors ×
    w_tape × half-life × own_fill_weight) on tick-scale MAE + bias per
    print; no credentials or config needed. **Blocked on data: needs a
    `--capture` session recorded during a live slate** — then the dose is
    pinned and ClearingPriceModel (Phase 4) ships.

32. [x] **65 — two-sided-flow admission.** *Shipped 2026-07-10 — finalists'
    last-hour prints must have the minority taker side ≥
    `min_minority_flow_ratio` of volume (falls back to print counts when
    sizes are absent; 0 = off, THE DEFAULT — enable per-config). Rationale
    hardened by run 20 + the parallel legs: one-way flow is the only
    remaining loss channel, and even perfect pricing only treads water in
    it (leg B of run 20: $0.00 ceiling). Demo sessions enable 0.2 in
    config-demo.* Original: **(proposed, awaiting Jacob).** Run
    19: 57 of 58 entry fills were the same side — demo taker flow is
    near-unidirectional in most books, so round trips can't complete and
    inventory exits at cost. The trades probe already parses the tape;
    `taker_side` is in the same response: require the minority side to have
    ≥ X% of recent prints before admission. Selects for the only market
    type where "collect spread, stay balanced" is physically possible.
    Input shipped 2026-07-09: the REST trades probe now parses taker side +
    size, and `TradeTape::minority_side_ratio` computes the live ratio —
    the gate itself (threshold + scanner wiring) awaits Jacob's confirm.

33. [x] **67 — reversion-score admission (Chakraborty–Kearns, studied
    2026-07-11; docs/papers §5).** Their Theorem 2.1: ladder-maker profit on
    ANY path = (K − z²)/2, K = Σ|Δprice|, z = net move — so admission should
    measure exactly that. Per finalist, from trailing 1-min candles (batched
    endpoint, one call): K̂ = Σ|Δclose|, ẑ = net Δclose over the window;
    admit when K̂ ≥ κ·ẑ² (κ config) and fold the ratio into the score. The
    direct, theory-grounded form of what item 65 (flow balance) and 60a
    (drift penalty) approximate. *Shipped 2026-07-11 — `min_reversion_kappa`
    (0 = off) over `reversion_window_minutes` (180) of 1-min trade closes
    via new `RestClient::get_candlesticks`; drop logs print K, κ, z²;
    <2 traded candles in-window = drop when the gate is on. Enable ~1.0–1.5
    in config-demo alongside the flow gate.*

34. [x] **68 — K/z² attribution split.** Add to `pnl_attribution.py`: per
    market per session, report harvested variation (K̂) vs net move (ẑ²)
    from the quote stream next to entry/drift/exit — every session becomes a
    live test of the (K − z²)/2 identity, and the number tells us whether a
    loss was "bad market selection" (z² blowup) vs "bad pricing" (thin K).
    *Shipped 2026-07-11. First datapoint: the one green session (07-10 leg A)
    ran on the only books with positive ceilings — TORRE (K−z²)/2 = +2.0c,
    SUPE +0.5c. The identity called our winner.*

35. [ ] **69 — per-market precision audit (Jacob, 2026-07-11: "I *think*
    markets have different precisions. I need my quantity type to take this
    into account.").** Evidence so far: subpenny pricing is per-market
    (getting_started/subpenny_pricing — legacy integer-cent fields deprecated
    2026-03-05, finer ticks near the 0/100 tails), market objects carry a
    `price_level_structure` field we currently ignore, and fills/counts are
    fixed-point 2dp (`count_fp` — `Quantity` stores centi-contracts). Audit
    both axes per market: price tick size (our `int price_cents` grid and
    every ±1-cent assumption in quoter/clamps/rounding breaks on subpenny
    books — the Hormuz UI confusion of 2026-07-10 was this rounding in the
    wild) and quantity step (verify 0.01 contracts is universal or make
    `Quantity`'s granularity per-market). Deliverable: parse
    `price_level_structure`, a per-market `MarketPrecision` carried through
    types, and conformance tests pinning live demo behavior before any live
    switch on a subpenny market.

36. [ ] **70 — max-hold forced exit (ND-HFTT study, docs/papers §6).** Our
    one loss channel is z² drift while warehousing one-way inventory; their
    91%-win maker capped it with a hard 30s holding-time limit — passive
    exit first, forced taker exit at the deadline, taker fee accepted as a
    bounded cost in place of unbounded drift. Add `max_hold_seconds` (0 =
    off): when any lot's age exceeds it, exit the remainder as a taker
    instead of resting at reservation forever. Complements item 64's unwind
    pricing (which lowers the exit price but still waits for a counterparty
    that one-way books never send). Tune against attribution: the flip is
    right when drift saved exceeds taker fee + spread paid.

37. [ ] **71 — crypto 15m series (KXBTC15M family): the always-on flow our
    scanner structurally excludes.** ND-HFTT's venue (~$170k notional per
    window, ~100 book updates/s, zero maker fees on that series in
    production). **Measured on DEMO 2026-07-11 ~22:15 CT (a Friday night
    when the sports scan admitted nothing): window 2315-15 printed 29
    trades in 13 min (≈130/hr vs our 6/hr gate), taker split 16 yes /
    13 no, 1,068 contracts, price range 1–56¢; prior windows 35 and 24
    trades.** By far the most quotable flow demo has, 24/7 — invisible to
    the scanner only because `min_days_to_close=1.0` discards sub-day
    markets before the flow gates run. Build: (a) per-window ticker
    resolution (compute next window from UTC; ND's coordinator pattern) +
    session lifecycle for 15-min markets — stop quoting ~60s before close,
    positions settle to 0/1 rather than exit; (b) quote only the 10–90¢
    middle band at first — these markets are `tapered_deci_cent` (0.1¢
    ticks in [0,10]¢ and [90,100]¢), so the integer-cent engine is only
    valid mid-range until item 69 lands; (c) external reference feed
    (Coinbase spot leads Kalshi ~1–2s) for the momentum cancel — the
    adverse-selection defense that made ND's maker work. Risks: terminal
    z is structural (every window converges to 0/1 — quote early/mid
    window, flee the end); production spreads compressed to zero at times
    by May 2026 as makers crowded in.

38. [ ] **72 — validate the backtest fill model against captured tape.**
    Our --backtest fills only on strict print-through — conservative by
    design, honesty unmeasured. ND-HFTT matched trade prints to negative
    top-of-book deltas within ±50ms and found 95.9% of negative top-deltas
    are real trades; their sim fills proportional to quote share of the
    level. We already capture both channels: run the same matching on our
    corpus to measure our print-through under-fill, and adopt proportional
    delta-consumption if the gap is material. Guards against the opposite
    failure too — a fill model that flatters a config would quietly rig the
    clearing-pricing verdict (task #4 rides on these replays).

**Selection principle (Jacob, 2026-07-04): profitable on every market we
CHOOSE, then scale.** Not every market can be made profitably — trending
books, dead books, and 1c-spread deep books all bleed makers. Scaling (Gate
2) multiplies per-market results, so the bar is: only quote markets where
measured expected edge is positive (liveness ✓, spread band ✓, drift penalty
= item 60a, toxicity floor = 60b), and exit any market whose live attribution
turns negative (rotation already provides the mechanism).

**Situational** (apply when relevant): 26 √-time size taper · 27 closing-day
longshot guard · 28 quarter-Kelly sizing (gate on 31) · 30 per-category debias
β · 34 sum-to-one monitor · 36 scanner volume-cap.

**Production readiness** (after Gate-1 definition): real-capture replay
fixture · 35 per-market position cap · 6 UBSan/TSan CI jobs · 7 tooling audit
· scanner in-play config flag (D8 follow-up).

## Gated behind Gate 2 (do not start)

Phase 21–26 scaling architecture, multi-exchange, FIX transport (see
north-star), `Session` concept — detail in the archive and
[ADR-007](docs/adr/007-process-per-strategy-and-aggregator.md). P3 structural
refactors (R1–R4, R7) never block the gates.

## State of play (2026-07-05)

- **Quoter** (full catalog + provenance: [docs/GUARDS.md](docs/GUARDS.md)):
  EMA fv + min-rest + adverse fade + LMSR skew (25×quote_size floor) +
  longshot floor + flow lean + inventory brake + wind-down + maker-favor
  rounding + crossed-book guard + own-quote subtraction. Validated: run 12
  in-play (0 fades, atomic amends); run 14 A/B vs run 13 on the same
  trending market: −$0.78 → −$0.20, peak inventory 30 → 10.
- **Loss taxonomy settled (runs 13/14)**: per-fill pricing earns (+0.5–2.5c
  entry edge); latency is a non-issue at demo speeds (1/45 picked off);
  exit machinery built. The remaining leak is quoting structurally trending
  markets — attacked by item 60a (drift estimator) + the selection
  principle.
- **Flow**: startup scans and selects its own live markets (top
  `trade_top_n`, default 1); liveness-filtered; rotated every 5 min;
  account-wide order hygiene at both ends of the session. Run 15
  (2026-07-05, first on fully-merged main): clean but zero fills on a quiet
  Saturday-morning book; scanner again picked a mention-family (trending)
  market — 60a's scanner penalty is the fix.
- **Measurement**: analytics JSONL (quotes, fills, http RTT) →
  `analyze_fills.py` (markout) + `pnl_attribution.py` (entry/drift/exit +
  picked-off) + `latency_report.py` (L0 baseline above).
- **Codebase**: cleanup pass 1+2 done — dead modules removed
  (`adverse_selection`, `write_trade_config`), `main.cpp` 810→~520 lines
  (mode runners in `app_modes.{hpp,cpp}`, tested), 1,233-line quoter test
  split into pricing + reprice suites. Suite 456 tests green.
- **Run 19 (2026-07-05, 15 min, 3 markets, kickoff window)**: 58 maker
  fills (vs 10 in run 18 — the throughput levers worked); first completed
  maker-maker round trip via unwind pricing (sold YES 79 / bought back 79,
  +0.5c edge). Net −$0.74: entry +0.77, drift −0.59 (CROS trended against
  the capped short), exit −0.92 (three taker flattens). Single remaining
  loss channel: one-way flow accumulates inventory that exits at cost —
  attacked by items 65 (two-sided admission), 66 (clearing-price fv), 60a
  (drift lean). Demo overrides active in config-demo: scanner
  min_spread 2, tape gate off, quoter 3/2, trade_top_n 3.
- **Demo carry ledger −$5.22** (`pnl_state.json`, 2026-07-05, post-run-19).
  PnL needs completed round trips, not just fills: two-sided books are the
  binding constraint on demo.
- Demo quirks: order entry can 503 exchange-wide while `/exchange/status`
  says active; fills can be fractional; laptop sleep mid-session is safe but
  wastes the session — soak runs belong on the L1 VM.

## External review reconciliation (2026-07-04, run-13 log)

An independent log review rated run 13 **8/10** ("behaving like a passive
liquidity provider; next phase is inventory management and measuring edge").
Reconciliation: its top findings — inventory grows unbounded, no reduction
logic, no realized spread capture — were fixed the same night (#85 wind-down,
#86 skew-per-fill cap, #87 flow lean + 2×-quote-size inventory brake), and
its "missing metrics" largely exist in the analytics JSONL + attribution/
markout scripts (invisible to a log-only review; item 45 will surface them
in the human log). Adopted as new items: 58 (startup scan efficiency), 59
(short-horizon markout + edge-by-inventory). Its "NO bid too aggressive"
hypothesis is contradicted by measured entry edge (+0.5–2c per fill,
1/35 picked off) — the leak was accumulation, not per-fill pricing.

## Working agreements

TDD; one PR per fix; PR descriptions start with a Review-order section;
**no stacked PR chains — sequential PRs on main** (stacked merges landed in
base branches instead of main on 2026-07-04 and had to be re-landed);
commits ≤15 words, no attribution; secrets live in
`/Users/jacobfreund/kalshi-demo-key/`, never in git; Mermaid diagrams in
docs/architecture.md.
